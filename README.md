## Description

_{ An introduction to the Gulp build tool by implementing Gulp in an existing project to build a development pipeline. The project concated & minified the js files, compiled multiple Sass files into a CSS file, created maps for both Sass and JS, created watch files to update js and sass files whenever they are updated, created a delete function that removes old copies of created production files, a build task that compiles the production app, a serve task that grabs watch task and starts a local server to development, and a default task that runs clean to remove the previous compiled files and runs build to compile new ones.

  Return is used in tasks to make sure that the individual tasks are run to completion before starting the next task.   }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Down the project files_
* _go to the location of the project files via the command line and type npm install_
* _Type gulp in the command line to make sure the production files are up to date_
* _To run a local server and to watch js and Sass files for change type gulp serve_
* _Open localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice_
* _To get your changes to come through, you may need to refresh using CMD-Shift_r_

_{The production files will be placed in the dist folder}_

## Known Bugs
